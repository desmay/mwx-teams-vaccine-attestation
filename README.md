## Attestation Solutions

There are a few variations of the solution and different factors within your organization will drive what version to use.  These include, but not limited to:
*  Organization Size
*  Microsoft 365 Version
*  Power Platform Licensing

### Microsoft Dataverse for Teams

The **[Microsoft Dataverse for Teams](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-platform/admin/about-teams-environment)** solution is for organizations that have Microsoft 365 licensing.  Organizations can deploy it as is or customize it to meet their requirements. Dataverse for Teams has a 2GB limit for environment (data) per team.  If you need more than 2GB of data, you will need to deploy to multiple teams or archive or remove previous attestations based on your organizations retention policy.

### Microsoft Dataverse ###

The Microsoft Dataverse for Teams solution can be upgraded to the **[Microsoft Dataverse](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powerapps/maker/data-platform/data-platform-intro)** if your organization has Power Platform user or app licensing.  The benefits of the Microsft Dataverse includes environment (data) size limit of 4TB.
